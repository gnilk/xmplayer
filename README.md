Very lousy FastTracker XM Player

No dependencies. After compile start with one of the files in the `assets` directory as argument.
Like: `macmix assets/VDLOVE.xm`

Written as a test (in 2004?) to fiddle with old Amiga MOD and FastTracker XM files.
Ported to macOS as a test to use Audio related stuff.

Added to github as a backup/reference.

NOTE: Extreme clicking..
